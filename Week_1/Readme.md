**Week 1 of my #1ProjectPerWeek challenge!**

Kicking off this journey where Iâ€™ll be building, modifying, and documenting one project every week â€” no excuses.
This weekâ€™s build: The **classic Dino Game**, but running on a tiny 128Ã—64 OLED display.

I took the nostalgic Chrome Dino and reimagined it for embedded hardware optimized frame rendering, added simple jump physics, and made it run smooth on limited resources.
Itâ€™s not just about remaking old games itâ€™s about learning how systems think in tight memory and timing constraints.

This marks the start of my consistency challenge 1 week, 1 project, every week.
If I skip, I double next week ðŸ˜¤
